# 🧠 Syllable OS Simulation – Operating Systems Project

This repository contains a comprehensive **simulation of Syllable OS internals**, designed as part of our Operating Systems coursework. The simulation models threading, process synchronization, memory management, disk partitioning, and file system operations, reflecting the design principles of the real-world [Syllable OS](https://syllable.metaproject.frl/).

## 📌 Project Overview

Syllable OS is a lightweight, POSIX-compliant operating system built for desktop PCs. This project replicates some of its **core components** using modular code to demonstrate:

- Contiguous memory allocation strategies (First Fit & Best Fit)
- Threading simulation in a monolithic kernel model
- Device management and disk partitioning
- Process synchronization using semaphores and resource trees
- Page replacement algorithms (LRU & Optimal)
- File system operations with Linux-like structure
- CLI and GUI-based exploration of Syllable OS
- Comparison with Unix system calls

> The aim is to visualize and implement core OS concepts using an educational, modular simulation approach.

### 📌 Review 2: Internal Simulations & Kernel Features

In the second phase of the project, we focused on simulating the core internal functionalities of the Syllable OS kernel. The following features were developed and demonstrated:

Threading Demo: A monolithic kernel-style threading system was implemented using a Kernel class that manages thread creation, execution, and synchronization using lock mechanisms.

Disk Partitioning: A device manager module was simulated to handle disk geometry and partitioning logic, including registration, renaming, deletion, and visualization of device nodes.

File Operations: A hierarchical file system was simulated, supporting file creation, reading, writing, and directory navigation, mimicking the Linux-based file structure of Syllable OS.

Memory Allocation: We implemented First Fit and Best Fit contiguous memory allocation strategies to simulate basic memory management at the kernel level.

Synchronization Tree: A semaphore-based synchronization system and resource tree were designed to manage concurrent access to shared resources between simulated processes.

Page Replacement: The LRU (Least Recently Used) and Optimal page replacement algorithms were simulated to compare memory management strategies and evaluate performance based on page fault minimization.
